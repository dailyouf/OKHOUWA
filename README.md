When I first wrote this code, only God and I knew how it worked.  
Now, only God knows.

So, if you are attempting to optimize this routine and it fails (as is highly probable),  
please consider increasing the following counter as a warning for the next person:  
`total_hours_wasted_here = 254`.

---

On a more serious note, this Git repository is primarily meant for collaborative support.  
If you encounter any errors or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to share your feedback.  
You can do so by commenting directly on the code or by submitting a new commit with your proposed changes.

Good luck, and happy coding! :)
